CS631 Cyber Security of Critical Infrastructure
Instructor: Professor Sandeep Kumar Shukla

CS631 is the course offered by Professor Sandeep Kumar Shukla in 2019-20 odd semester. This repository contains assignment done during course. 
<br/><br/>
Homework3:  
This homework is based on the paper: “Truth Will Out: Departure-Based Process-Level Detection of Stealthy Attacks on Control Systems” by Aoudi, Iturbe, and Almgren which appeared in CCS’18. We implemented the PASAD technique.
<br/><br/>
Homework4:
This homework uses decision tree based learning as well as PCA based dimensionality reduction followed by any classification algorithm -- to create two models to distinguish between stressed grid condition and nominal grid condition. How the data is generated is described in the paper “Methodology for a Security/Dependability Adaptive Protection Scheme Based on Data Mining” by Bernabeu, Thorp, Centeno.
<br/><br/>
Homework5:
This homework is based on paper "Open Set Intrusion recognition for fine-grained Attack Categorization".
<br/><br/>
Homework6:
This homework uses a diffusion map-based dimensionality reduction followed by any unsupervised classification algorithm to create a model to distinguish between stressed grid condition and nominal grid condition.
